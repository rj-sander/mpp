        <a name="intro">M</a> goes to an art group once a week. It’s a close-knit community of regular attendees who often see each other outside of workshops; the atmosphere is jovial and collaborative. Some attendees are photographers and will snap photos of people’s work and portraits of group members. But M catches one of them towards the end of the workshop as people pack up. “Please don’t post any photos of me on social media,” they ask. This a reasonable request and not unusual as people become more concerned with online privacy. But M isn’t worried about their privacy - they’re worried about their benefits.

        M was left with limited mobility after an accident a few years ago - they use a wheelchair and need a part-time carer. They qualify for Personal Independence Payment, or PIP, which replaced the Disability Living Allowance in 2013. Through their local council, they also qualify for other kinds of aid, including reduced council tax. PIP is means tested, so to qualify for payments, individuals are regularly assessed to determine their distinct needs. Local councils are within their rights to investigate allegations of fraud in this ecosystem and can report any findings to the DWP to adjust or even deny people’s financial aid. Social media has formed a part of these investigations, and this, coupled with a lack of transparency from the institutions, has created a culture where benefits recipients feel they have to self-censor to keep themselves safe. As M puts it, “If an investigator sees me at this art group, even though I’m only here for a few hours once a week, they might conclude that I don’t need my carer at all from now on, and that would make my life so much harder.”

        As life has become more digital, government bodies are struggling to keep up and create policies that can protect people from unnecessary intrusion. Local councils have been either slow or completely disinterested in creating guardrails for how they can investigate their constituents. People like M are left entirely in the dark about what could prompt an investigation, what they’re looking for, and what they can look at. All they know is that they can.

<h2>Covert and Overt Surveillance</h2>
<p>
When talking about surveillance, it is helpful to use two key definitions: covert and overt. The Surveillance Commissioner’s Guidance defines overt social media monitoring as looking at ‘open source’ data, publicly available data and data where privacy settings are available but not applied. This, in practice, means anything that exists online that doesn’t require circumventing privacy tools to access. This could include a user's profile pages and posts, posts they’ve interacted with, their followers and the accounts they follow. Surveillance may be covert once there are repeated examinations of the same source. Once this happens, it should be classed as Direct Surveillance and come under the legal framework of the Regulatory of Investigative Powers (RIPA) Act. Covert surveillance requires much more oversight and authorisation. However, these guidelines are difficult to apply in the world of social media; you can scroll through a person’s entire Instagram profile while technically staying on the same web page, so is that overt? What constitutes repeated views in the infinite scroll world?
<br /><br />
With guidance this vague, it is up to individual councils to set their own standards. Rick Burgess of the Greater Manchester Disability Coalition is concerned about how prohibitive this environment can be. “You never know what they [the DWP] might do. So it's, no news is good news, have as little contact with it as possible: “Yes, please” and “thank you”, and then remain as invisible as possible. A lot of people live like that. If they forget about you, they don’t do horrible things to you. This is the money people rely on for food, paying bills. It’s not a debatable need, it’s a basic human need to survive. And they have so many ways of stopping it, which is terrifying.”

This kind of threat can stifle the ability of disabled people to participate in all activities, but in a fateful twist, it can also discourage public protest. The Greater Manchester Coalition for Disabled People, which organises around issues beyond disability, has seen police threaten members at protests with DWP investigations.  According to Rick Burgess, “Any protest we go to, every person that's there is representing maybe ten more who didn't want to come, not wanting to be at risk.”

The entire experience can be incredibly isolating. “When you're under the DWP, particularly means-tested benefits, you don't live in the same country as everyone else,” says Burgess. “To the extent that there are human rights protections generally in our society, and it's debatable how effective they are, if you're under the DWP, you live under a different nation, a nation of extreme, authoritarian overreach.”

<p>In the long term, organisations like Privacy International are campaigning for covert surveillance and more transparency over what councils are doing. For now, advice for people living under the threat of surveillance is unfortunately clear: privacy. “the good basic advice is to lock down your social media,” says Rick Burgess, “don't share your life with the public. It’s a human rights issue to me. People self-police their lives. They don't publicly enjoy themselves.”
